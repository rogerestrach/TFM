# Preface {-} 

This investigation arises in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and after the cancellation of a previous investigation, in which was studied the Air Traffic Controller's Fatigue. Coronavirus has forced almost everyone to redraw their present and reformulate their near-future.

Since the begininng of the worldwide outbrake it was clear the COVID-19 will hit the aviation industry as never seen before. Several studies started to emerge analysing the Air Traffic impact, however, no one was focused in the routes' adjustments by the airlines. Looking for a different approach, together with the supervisors, we came up with the idea of explaning the pandemic through the routes alterations and to extract, if present, the airlines' strategy. 
This project has represented a challenge not only in the data collection but, in its interpretation and representation in the following book.
