# Preface {-} 

This investigation arises in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and after the cancellation of a previous investigation, in which was studied the Air Traffic Controller's Fatigue. Coronavirus has forced almost everyone to redraw their present and reformulate their near-future.

Since the begininng of the worldwide outbrake it was clear the COVID-19 will hit the aviation industry as never seen before. Several studies started to emerge analysing the Air Traffic impact, however, no one was focused in the routes' adjustments by the airlines. Looking for a different approach, together with the supervisors, we came up with the idea of explaning the pandemic through the routes alterations and to extract, if present, the airlines' strategy. 
This project has represented a challenge not only in the data collection but, in its interpretation and representation in the following book.

# Acknoledgements {-}

The following pages represent the fulfillment of my aerospace engineering studies. It is for this reason that firstly I would like to show my gratitude to all those who have been by my side during this journey, who have encouraged and believed in me. 

Elaborating this project has represented a challenge since the very beginning. Coronavirus has forced me to leave a previous study unfinished. Even though, and thanks to my supervisors Oriol Lordan and Jose Maria Sallan, I have overcome the situation elaborating what I consider to be a fascinating project. I would like to express my appreciation to them not only for its readiness to help but, to advice and support me in a totally unexpected situation.

The completion of this project would not have been possible without the contirbution of Carlota, Pol and Cristina. They made an enormous effort elaborating with me the required database in record time. I would like to express my sincere gratitude for their help. Their genoristy has totally overwhelmed me.

I want to give a special mention to my best friend and partner Quit, her positivism and company has allowed me to face this project with enthusiasm and determination.

Finally, a big thanks to my parents for their unconditional support, help and love. I owe my success to them.

# Introduction {#intro}

The coronavirus pandemic represents one of the most challenging events of the 21st century. For everyday people, it will be remembered as the isolation era and those days with unusual routines. The lockdown has carried the temporary closure of shops and the cancellation or postponement of most of the events scheduled for 2020. The COVID-19 has forced almost everyone to reformulate their near future with a high price to pay.

The economic impact induced from the pandemic will be devastating. The Air Transport of passengers and the aviation industry has been one of the hardest hit sectors. Measures like the isolation, the travel ban and the social distancing are totally in contrast to what aviation is.
The ICAO predicts that full-year air passenger traffic for 2020 (domestic and international) is expected to be down from a 45\% to 62\% compared to 2019^[As of June 8.]. In other words, airline passenger revenues will drop approximately 300 to 400 billion dollars in 2020, a 55\% decline compared to 2019. Airlines are in danger, being the lack of liquidity one of the main challenges they will face.

The project begins explaining the future that the aviation industry was forecasting before the COVID-19 outbreak. After that, it is explained the arrival of the virus and its global spreading. Followingly, it is presented the main part of the project, the data analysis.<br>
Its ojective is to analyze the database. Among others, it is studied the airlines affected, the duration and anticipation of the adjustments, and the outbreak throughout the routes adjusted. <br> Afterwards, there are presented the new scenarios foreseen for the future of the aviation sector. And finally, all the conclusions obtained are gathered and discussed. 

## Aim {#aim}
It is clear that the aviation is the way of transport most affected by COVID-19, it is because of that, this project pretends to visualise the pandemic evolution across the world throughout the adjustments in the scheduled frequencies of passenger service airlines.

Moreover, with all the data collected will be determined the most affected airlines, the duration and anticipation of the adjustments and the strategy followed by the air carriers. This will be developed always considering the number of cases per country and under the prespective of the global spreading.

## Scope {#scope}

Due to the complexity of the study, particularly working in the database, it has been chosen a specific period of time. The analysis will be done from January 23 when the city of Wuhan was put under lockdown to April 7, a day before the city was opened up. This investigation comprises the schedules adjustments from world's airlines, allowing to analyse the pandemic from a global point of view. 

## Objectives {#objectives}

Following are listed the main objectives of the project:

- To explain the situation of the Air Traffic sector before and during the pandemic.
- To generate a database listing the schedule adjustments of the passenger service airlines during the period of time selected.
- To explain the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures applied through the schedules adjustments.
- To represent the data collected in a clear and understandable way.
- To understand, determine and reflect the strategic measures applied by the airlines.
- To generate an interactive document to facilitate the understanding and comprehension of the pandemic outbreak in *R-Bookdown*.

## Specific Requirements {#spec}

In order to perform this project there are a list of requirements:

- To have access to the schedule adjustments of the airlines.
- To have access to a database with all the measures applied by the world's governments in front of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- To have a database containig the location of the worlwide aiports.
- To subscribe to *Flourish Studio* premium version.

## Justification {#just}

Almost everyone has experienced the impact induced by COVID-19 or has heard about the economic implications of its outbreak.
As it will be studied, the Air Transport industry has been one of the most affected sectors. This project provides the opportunity not only to study this affectation but, to deliver a list of representations to visualize the repercussions on air traffic network. <br> 


<!--chapter:end:04-intro.Rmd-->

# Air Transport Evolution and Forecast before COVID-19 {#ATEvo}

The aviation industry has experienced a spectacular rise in the last 20 years,with passenger numbers more than doubling from 1.5 billion in 1998 to nearly 4 billion in 2017. The sector has been characterised for experiencing peak cycles and stagnation stages, but it is one of the most consolidated industries.

During the last years, airlines have been grounding the old aircraft, renewing their fleets with more fuel-efficient planes and serving more and more passengers.  With the emerge of the low-cost flights, flying have been extended to all public, forcing the airlines to become more sophisticated retailers to compete with the prices while maintaining healthy profitability.

It has become very common to hear about the healthy  of the sector and its promising future. All the institutions, including the ICAO, IATA and the two big manufacturers Boeing and Airbus forecast a continuous growth for the industry at least until 2040. The reason behind is the Asiatic continent.<br>
It is well known in both, the United States and Europe the commercial aviation is well established. Asia though, in the last decade is experiencing an unprecedented growth.<br>
The economical growth of the countries historically less developed, has resulted to be the best enhancer for the development of the Asiatic aviation and for the international traffic in general.
The development of the aviation in Asia has gone together with an increase of the middle class in the region, now having higher financial capacity to fly than ever. It is expected that by 2030 two-thirds of the world's middle class will be located in Asia-Pacific region. [@grupooneair]

```{r TForecast, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Traffic Forecast for 2038. Source: [@Airbus_GMF].'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Fotos_evo/av2038.jpg")
```

As said before, when discussing the air transport market, it is very common to hear the word "cyclically". The main reason is the number of cycles the industry has experimented since 1990. Analysing the last years of the industry, the first decade of the new millennium resulted to be the most significant with two global events: The 9/11 in 2001 and the financial crisis in 2008/2009. And one more regional, but no less difficult, the SARS outbreak in Asia. <br>
What made these more challenging was the fact of they followed one after the other. Even though, the traffic was able to rebound and return to its long term tendency. The Figure \@ref(fig:TF2038) gives an overall view of the revenues per passenger-kilometre growth of the last 70 years. It can be easily seen, despite the global events, the industry has been able to rebound and continue its growing tendency. As stated in GMF 2019-2039 by @Airbus_GMF *"the traffic has proven to be resilient to external shocks"*.

```{r TF2038, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Traffic Forecast for 2038. Source: [@EcDevICAO].'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Fotos_evo/WorldAviation.png")
```


The air transport industry has resulted to be not only very important in terms of global socio-economic growth but, a vital catalyst for economic development. The industry is creating direct and indirect employment, enhancing tourism and stimulating foreign investment as ICAO details in *Economic Development of Air Transport* [@EcDevICAO]. <br>
Since 1995 to 2012, and as represented in Figure \@ref(fig:WEG), the world passenger air traffic followed the tendency of the world economy. Annually the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at 2.8\% while the passenger air traffic, expressed in Revenue Passenger- Kilometer increased at 5\%. 

```{r WEG, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='World Economic growth *vs* air traffic growth. Source: [@EcDevICAO].'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Fotos_evo/WorldEconomicGrowth.png")
```

Moving back to this last decade, from 2010 the industry has been free of events. This has allowed the industry to meet the needs of passengers, who have been unimpeded by the impact of these cycles. In consequence, the airlines have made almost the same profit from 2015 to 2019 than the one generated between 1970 and 2014.

The industry has lived its best years and are foreseen more to come. For the next 20 years, Airbus Global Market forecasts [@Airbus_GMF] a 4.3\% global annual air traffic growth. As mentioned, the key is the expansion of the sector in the Asia-Pacific region, which will lead the world traffic by 2038.

In terms of network, the year 2017-2018 was the most active in a new route creation. In fact, the last three years have been very positive when adding new routes, many of them being short-haul routes focusing on China and some between Africa and Europe. <br>
Long haul routes have also grown over this period with the emergence of long haul low-cost airlines like LEVEL, Norwegian and Eurowings, among others. 

```{r routesevo, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Total route creation. Source: [@Airbus_GMF].'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Fotos_evo/Routes_evo.png")
```


The present was in good health and the future forecast was promising.
The industry was going better like never before, giving the best future expectations of the sector's history. The airlines thought that they were ready for everything. Everything, except the imminent COVID-19 worldwide pandemic.

# The Global Spread of Coronavirus {#Arr}


On December 31, 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted by China about several cases of unusual pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, province of Hubei. The virus was unknown but, several of those infected worked at the city’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which was shut down on January 1, 2020. Despite the closure and the disinfection of the installations, the virus was already spreading outside reaching the 44 case-patients by January 3.

It was necessary seven days to isolate the new pathogen. In January 7, the Chinese authorities announced they had identified a new virus, now named 2019-nCoV and classified into the coronavirus family. It was 2 days later when coronavirus claimed the first victim.  On January 20, there were already 282 confirmed cases from four different countries: Thailand, Japan, the Republic of Korea and China, who reported its third death.

In the week of January 23 less than 15\% of new cases had visited the Hunan market. There was more evidence that 2019-nCoV had spread from human to human. In consequence, the fear of a major outbrake raised as millions of people travelled for the Lunar New Year Holiday. <br>
From January 20 to January 23 the cases were more than duplicated in China and in the United states the first positive was reported. Finally, in January 23 the cities of Wuhan, Xiantao and Chibi in Hubei province were placed under effective quarantine. First air transport measures arrived and departures from these cities were suspended. By the end of the week, more Chinese regions would be lockdown affecting 56 million people.  

Being a new virus, with no vaccines the only way to stop or reduce its spread was by locking down people. This is in contraposition to what aviation is, and the reason why aviation is probably the industry more impacted by COVID-19. In order to isolate people and to avoid the spreading, one of the measures applied by governments was to ban travel.

As explained, in this stage of the pandemic the transmission mainly took place in China. The solution was at that moment still easy: ban the travel from China. This measure was rapidly taken by several countries like the United States of America or Afghanistan. Others like Canada or Thailand highly recommended to avoid travelling to China. In response to the drop in demand, several airlines cancelled their flights to China. Even though, the financial aftereffect of closing the borders was limited due to only a few foreign airlines were exposed to China. This was partly due to the strength of the Chinese airlines in China, which are mostly owned by the government of the country meaning they could take the hit. Several airlines of nearby countries  would be affected and would struggle but, the lock-down of China was still a focused measure that could be handled.

```{r ChinaLockdown, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Some of the most affected foreign carriers by the China lockdown.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Maps/China_Lockdown.png")
```


It was not until the January 30 when WHO declared the global emergency. By that day, deaths in China jumped to 170, there were more than 7.5 K cases confirmed in 18 different countries around the globe including Australia, France, Finland, Germany, Canada, among others. New travel ban were also applied to the most affected countries: Firstly South Korea and some days after Iran. 

In the following days, more cases were confirmed in India, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and it was on February 2, the Philippines reported the first death outside China. It was 4 days later, on February 6, when Malaysian authorities reported the country’s first known human to human transmission, meanwhile, in Europe the number of infected people reached 30. 

On February 9, the number of deaths in China surpassed that caused by 2002/2003 SARS epidemic, with 811 deaths and 37 K infections. Next days the virus continued spreading and several countries reported their first deaths. On February 11, WHO announced the disease caused by the new coronavirus would be called, COVID-19 meanwhile the virus itself would be named as SARS-CoV-2.

By February 27, the global  infections passed 82 K, including more than 2.8 K deaths. This week marked the confirmation of first cases in countries around the world. In Europe, Italy was the country hardest hit and also the first to impose a quarantine. On March 8, the region of Lombardy and other 14 areas in the north of Italy were lockdown, affecting a total of 16 M people. In response, the airlines cancelled the flights to the North of the Italian boot, but the virus could not be retained and spread around Europe. <br>
Europe would become the centre of the pandemic, the first fatal hit to the aviation industry by COVID-19 outbreak.

The virus was devastating the European continent, home by revenue of 3 of the 6 largest airline groups in the world: AirFrance KLM (Air France and KLM), Lufthansa Group (Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, Swiss Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Eurowings) and IAG (Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, LEVEL and Vueling. With governments now applying new measures, no-one wanted to travel to Europe, the demand dropped. It was the origin of an unsustainable situation for the industry. 

```{r EuropeAirl, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Airlines forming the IAG, AirFrance KLM and Lufthansa Group'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Maps/Europe.png")
```

On March 11, the virus was a reality around the world and a truly concern. It was that day when WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. This would be the beginning of the biggest strike in the history of the aviation industry. 

The virus spread fast and aggressively and at the other side of the Atlantic, the measures did not take long to arrive. On March 11, the president of the United States of America, Trump appeared announcing some of the measures the government will be applying in response to the virus. Being the most shocking, the travel ban from European passengers starting on March 13 and for 30 days. <br>
This was an unprecedented measure, considering the United States and Europe are two of the most economically linked regions of the world. More than 1.5 K flights cross the Atlantic sea per day, a travel ban between the two regions was an imaginable measure. This will represent the second fatal hit to the aviation industry.

Banning traffic between the United States and Europe will affect an enormous number of people and will represent a major hit to the airlines of both countries. For these, long-haul flights are the most profitable. <br>
In the next days, Delta, United and American Airlines will join the big Europeans (IAG, AirFrance KLM and Lufthansa Group). The six biggest airlines of the world by revenue will experince a massive drop in demand.  

```{r USAAirl, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The big three airlines in the United States'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Maps/USA.png")
```
But not only the transatlantic long haul-flights decreased in demand, the domestic European travel dropped like never before. Most every airline of Europe started experiencing what is called net negative bookings. In other words, airlines were refunding more bookings than they had coming in. [@fightingForSurvival]

By the end of March, the number of cases increased to 750 K and the coronavirus related deaths surpassed 35 K around the world. <br>
Meanwhile, in Europe the number of cases started to reduce. It was different for America, where the virus started to hit stronger. In fact, on March 31 the number of deaths in US surpassed those reported by China, in which thanks to the lock-down, the strict commitment of Chinese people and the strong measures applied for the government, since March 10 the daily new cases reduced to nearly zero. Finally, on April 8, 76 days later sealing off the city, Wuhan population was allowed to leave. It took around two months to stabilise the number of cases to 80 K and the deaths to 4.5 K.

On the other hand, in Europe, by April 8 Spain ranked as the most affected country of the region with around 140 K cases, followed by Italy (135 K), Germany (100 K), France (77 K), among others. The United States presented more than 300 K cases, being clear both continents had still a lot to do in order to flatten the curve. [@covid_evo]

Previous explanation is complemented by the following graphic, which showcases the development of the pandemic by representing the evolution of the new confirmed cases per region and per day.


<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="Visualizations/NewCases/index.html">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Visualizations/NewCases/style.css"  />
<script src="Visualizations/NewCases/flourish.embed.js"></script></div>
```{r NewCases, echo=FALSE,  out.height='0.0001%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='New confirmed cases of COVID-19 per region.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/blank.png")
```
As explained, the outbreak started in China (Eastern Asia). When the propagation seemed to end, in other regions the new cases started to rise significantly, being especially noticeable in Europe. <br>
It is also visible that the last region to be hit was America. In North-America, as said, the virus spread fiercely, being the region were the new cases grew more rapidly. Meanwhile, the spreading in South America is not visible since it took place out of the period analyzed.<br> Finally, it is interesting to explain the pick value visible in Eastern Asia on February 13. This is not a reversal in the trend since it does only represent a change in how cases were diagnosed and reported. Most of the new 13 K reported cases related to a period going back days and weeks. They were reported as cases on a single day, but they need to be distributed in the preceding period.

As seen in Chapter \@ref(ATEvo), aviation industry has had to face several difficult circumstances. Almost 20 years ago, in 2001, the 9/11 affected the sector in many ways, being the most dramatic event for the industry.  Three days after the terrorist attack, some of the major US airlines were laying off thousands of personnel, many people lost their jobs and several airlines went into bankruptcy protection. Air travel was down 1.5\%. 
Seven years later, in 2008 with the great recession, the industry lost nearly 1\%. Even though, aviation made it through and recovered. With coronavirus outbrake, air travel is expected to be down 48\%^[As of April 14.] in 2020.

Coronovirus pandemic has hit the travel industry and generating a drop in demand that was not seen even after the 9/11. This scenario is completely new for the sector with the biggest uncertainty of having no visibility when this is going to end. [@USAirlinesSurvive]

# Routes Impact Analysis {#Imp}

As Ben Baldanza, previous CEO and president of Spirit Airlines, says in [@USAirlinesSurvive], *"When flying and in trouble, no matters what it is, the altitude, the remaining fuel or even the radio communications. The first order of business is to keep the wings straight and level."* <br>
Somehow, this is the airline's mentality. In front of a totally new situation, their objective is to stay afloat. And the only way to do it is preserving cash. To do so, they are erasing those routes/frequencies temporary unprofitable or the law forbid to fly. 

This is what is going to be studied in the following section. But before proceeding to the analysis of these adjustments, it is explained the methodology followed.


## Methodology {#ImpMeth}

Firstly, it has been necessary to elaborate the database. From the latter will be generated the graphics and animations that will allow the explanation of the pandemic. In order to generate the database then, it is a requisite to have access to the schedule adjustments of the airlines. This information is usually private and it is necessary to pay for it. However, it has been found an alternative, an open source called <a href="https://www.routesonline.com/">*RoutesOnline*</a>. This is a webpage that has a section titled <a href="https://www.routesonline.com/news/38/airlineroute/">*"AirlineRoute"*</a>  in which they gather  the schedule adjustments from world's airlines. In front of the COVID-19 outbreak, it was created a specific section for the coronavirus pandemic. In the latter, <a href="https://www.routesonline.com/">*RoutesOnline*</a> has been collecting the airlines' adjustments since January 23 and will continue until the end of the pandemic. However, as they state in their webpage:

*"Airlineroute is run by a team of one (with the exception of Routes Editorial Opinion and Live Blog Post), and due to extraordinary numbers of flight adjustments, Airlineroute may not be able to cover every carrier, but will report them as many as possible."*

It is because of that, it cannot be ensured that the database lists all the adjustements applied by the airlines. Even though, and as it can be seen in the following pages, the information collected has allowed to face most of the project's objectives.

Once elaborated the database, the study has proceeded with the representation of the data. There have been created several animations to ease the understanding and to make the process as interactive as possible.
Finally, the animations have been studied and there have been extracted the related conclusions.


## Database {#ImpDat}

The schedules adjustments posted on <a href="https://www.routesonline.com/">*RoutesOnline*</a> required to be arranged and listed in an excel format. The *OnlineRoutes*'s post are not all  structured in the same manner, it is for this reason that the excel document has been manually elaborated.

In the following Table is shown the database structure:



```{r Example, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(readr)
library(kableExtra)
Example <- read_csv2("Data/Example.csv")
knitr::kable(Example,align = 'c', caption = "Database structure.") %>%
    kable_styling(font_size = 12) %>%
    scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "100%")
```


The database is structured in such a way that each row represents an adjustment in an airline's flight schedule. Following are explained each of the blanks to be filled: 


- __*Country*__: It states where the airline is based.
- __*Region*__: It classifies the previously mentioned country into a United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) region.

```{r Regions, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The United Nations geoscheme'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/impact/regions.png")
```

- __*Airiline*__: Name of the airline modifying its schedule.
- __*From*__: Origin of the route modified.
- __*To*__: Destination of the route modified.
- __*From (Airport)*__: Identification code of the origin airport. This value references to another database listing all the airports with their corresponding locations and identification codes. (See in See Appendix B)
- __*To (Airport)*__: Identification code of the destination airport. This value references to another database listing all the airports with their corresponding locations and identification codes. (See Appendix B)
- __*Type of ajustment*__: Identification number

    - __*1*__: Route Cancelled.
    
    - __*2*__: Route with a reduction in frequencies.
    
    - __*3*__: Route with an increase in frequencies.
    
    - __*4*__: Route closed for reservation.
    
- __*Frequencies (Before)*__: Number of frequencies scheduled before the modification.
    
- __*Frequencies (After)*__: Number of frequencies scheduled after the modification.
    
- __*Publication Date*__: Schedule adjustment notification date.
    
- __*Starting Date*__: The first day the adjustment applies. 
    
- __*Ending Date*__: Last day the adjustment applies.  

In the next table are detailed the main characteristics of the database^[The Database is attached in the Appendix A.] elaborated:

```{r InterestValues, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE}

## Analysis {#ImpAn}

As mentioned, the objective of the following section, and as a main part of the project, is to analyze the data collected.
 
### The pandemic outbreak throughout the schedules adjustments {#ImpAn1}
 
 Firstly, it will be determined if the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic can be represented throughout the evolution of the schedules adjustments. To do so, it will be used the next animation, in which are represented the affectations in the routes throughout the period studied.
 
 The schedules modifications have been represented depending on its nature:
 

- In <span style="color:red">red</span> are drawn the routes that have been canceled by some airline.
- In <span style="color:orange">orange</span> are represented those routes seeing a reduction in their frequencies.
- In <span style="color:green">green</span> represented those routes seeing an increase in their frequencies.
- In <span style="color:blue">blue</span> are plot the routes in which some airline have closed the reservation.

Below is attached the animation in question. By clicking the play button placed at the bottom left corner, the representation will start.

```



The presentation starts on January 22, being visible the effects of the pandemic just the day after. On January 23, the city of Wuhan is placed under lockdown and with this, the first cancellations arise. Until   January 29, it can be seen the affectation takes place mainly at Eastern Asia in a radial form with the epicenter in Wuhan. Even though, some routes from Europe and North-America are being also altered. Some examples are those flown by  British, Lufthansa or American airlines to China, from now on canceled.

On January 30, the WHO (*World Health Organization*) declares the COVID-19 a global emergency. China has now reported cases in all its provincial divisions and countries like India and Philippines announce their first positives. Others like France, Italy, Germany or South Korea report new cases. On the same day and the day after of the WHO declaration, it becomes obvious the repercussion the virus will have on the air transport across the globe. The routes affected increase drastically, being now more international rather than domestic. Even tough and as the routes show, the virus is in its majority in Eastern Asia, specifically in China.

As February begins, some countries respond to the global emergency declaration from WHO. A growing number of states start introducing temperature sensors and scanners in their airports. Others like Bahamas, Indonesia, Mauritius or Israel introduce quarantine measures for those arriving from China or suspected of having the virus. This measure will be followed by countries around the globe in the next days.
These measures though, are rapidly not enough and the countries proceed to ban the flights from or to China. Some examples are Mauritius and Singapore (February 2), Israel (February 3), Indonesia and Turkey (February 5). Despite the efforts, the virus spread rapidly and more countries are infected during the month. The measures applied for China will be now applied for these. Even though, this can not be explained through the schedules adjustments. As represented the modifications grow gradually and all around Eastern Asia, being not visible any specific travel ban. 

However, it is interesting to notice the changes in the nature of adjustments. With the closure of the city of Wuhan, the adjustments in both long-haul and short-haul routes were all cancellations. This behavior changes on January 31-February 1, when several routes are "Closed for reservation". As it is detailed in Section \@ref(ImpAn6), this may be related with the airlines' strategy.

February is also complicated for Europe, Italy will become the third most affected country by the end of the month. In response, some countries introduce travel restrictions for passengers who had been in Italy: Switzerland (February 13), Turkey (February 16), Kuwait (February 20) and Mauritius (February 24) among others. Even though, no major affectations compared to the rest of Europe are visible. 
It starts to be noticeable on February 28, when El Al (Israel Airlines) cancels all flights to Italy following the travel limitations imposed by the Health and Interior ministries of the country.<br> 
One day after, on February 29, Italy has more than 1 K confirmed cases and South Korea more than 3 K. This same day, the Ministry of Health of Turkey announces the flight suspension to Italy, Iraq and South Korea, a measure that can be also seen in the map.

On March 1, the flag carrier of Italy (*Alitalia*) announces a frequency reduction to most of its domestic routes, clearly visible in the animation. During the next 6 days, other airlines will adjust their routes to Italy, even though, there are no significant adjustments. This changes rapidly on March 8.<br>
Italy, until now with only 10 municipalities of Lodi province under lockdown,  decides to extend the quarantine to the entire region of Lombardy and 14 regions more of the north of the country. This provokes new affectations in domestic and international routes, mainly from/to Europe. Even though, some long-haul routes from North and South America involving Rome airport are also affected. This is likely to be an anticipation move by the airlines who may predict what is coming: Europe will become the new epicenter of the pandemic.

On March 9 there are no significant changes in the overall scenario. However, one of the major airlines around the world, Emirates Airlines files some service changes. It is suffering from low demand caused by the pandemic, deciding to cancel some short-haul routes and idling some A380 of its fleet. <br>
One day after, on March 10, Europe tinges red. Italy announces the quarantine of the entire country. Italy is now the second most hit country with more than 10 K cases. Airports, that until this day were not affected, show now canceled routes. 


On March 11 there are more than 125 K cases around the world and the WHO declares the COVID-19 a global pandemic. More routes to/from Italy are canceled mainly to/from other European countries and North America.
This same day the president of The United States announces travel ban from Schengen Area to the US in bid to stem coronavirus. This measure will go into effect the Friday 13th of March^[The United Kingdom and Ireland were initially exempt but will be also included on March 17.], generating a cloud of canceled routes over the Atlantic sea.
From that day, the chaos is taking hold of Europe and its countries start proclaiming the state of alarm and the total confinement for their citizens: Portugal on March 13 followed by Spain on March 14 and Poland on March 15. Austria on March 16 and France and Belgium on March 17. Of the last are Greece and the UK on March 23. Until March 23 it is very complicated to detect any airline sprecific reaction, since the adjustments are widespread around Europe.


In the north of the African continent, on March 14/March 15 is visible a significant increase of canceled routes in Algeria and Morocco respectively. The affectations in Algeria are explained by the service cancellation to France by the flag airline, Air Algerie. Meanwhile, in Morocco, the adjustments are aintroduced by Royal Air Maroc after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that all international passenger flights to and from the country would be suspended.

Back to March 13, in the Arabian peninsula, it can be seen an increase in affected routes, concretely in Kuwait. The reason behind is the total closure of Kuwait International Airport. The government takes this measure with the objective to isolate the country from the rest of the world. Kuwait becomes the first country to close completely its main airport as a preventive measure with 72 positive cases. Two days after, on March 15, Saudi Arabia announces the travel ban from/to the country. The airlines' response to this measure is clearly visible as the routes cancellations in Jeddah rise immediately.

In Russia, from March 13 and for an undetermined period of time, is limited the air traffic with Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. This measure is represented with an increase of canceled routes mainly in the Capital Moscow, and in St. Petersburg. Still in Easter Europe, the increase of adjustments is even more substantial on March 16. Russia introduces new limitations and Aeroflot, the flag carrier of the country, introduces new flight reductions in its schedule. This same day Uzbekistan closes its air borders and with it new cancellations arise. 

Jumping to southeastern Asia, on March 15, the city of Manila (Philippines) is placed under lockdown, generating new cancellations. This measure is also imposed on the city of Cebu the next day, forcing the flag carrier of the county, Cebu Pacific, to cancel its routes to/from Cebu from March 17. This generates a new raise in cancellations the same day the country is declared under a state of calamity for a tentative period of six months.

On March 17, China is still the country more hit, with 81 K positive cases. Italy presents 30 K and is followed by Spain with 16 K, which has just surpassed Iran. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic sea, until now with minor affectations,  the first measures start to arrive. <br>
In Peru, with 117 positive cases, come into effect the state of emergency announced the day before, and there are suspended all the international flights of passengers.<br>
On March 18 Chile enacts the state of alarm and the day after, in the Dominican Republic, President Medina announces the suspension of inbound air traffic. However, this measure cannot be seen in the data collected.<br>
Otherwise, on March 23, Colombia forbids international flights and Panama closes its air borders, center America tinges red. By that day, in South America, Brazil is the most hit country with more than 1.5 K cases, followed by Ecuador with 850 and Chile 663.
The most severe measures in Brazil will arrive on March 30 closing its borders, however, it is not visible any significant affectation.

Crossing again the Atlantic sea and back to March 19, Egypt closes their airports for international flights, being noticeable the increase of adjustments especially in Cairo.
In Southeastern Asia, Air Asia Thailand announces the suspension of all its international flights, as well as, the reduction in frequencies for its domestic routes. Both measures come into effect on March 22, being visible the increase of cancellations in the airports of the country, espacially in the capital, Bangkok.

On March 25 Australia ranks as the 17th most hit country, with 2.7 K cases. This day the country forbids its citizens to leave the country with only a few exceptions. This measure provokes a rise in schedule adjustments of those routes involving Australian airports. Three days after, on March 28, the Malaysian low-costs AirAsia and AirAsia suspend their operations tingeing the skies of Malaysia in red. 

Finally, in the last stage of the animation, from March 28 to April 7, some routes that were canceled or reduced start reopening or showing increments in their frequencies, being especially noticeable on March 29.    
  
In order to visualize the previous commented increases in late March, is attached the following graphic.

```{r space4, echo=FALSE,  out.height='0.0001%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/blank.png")
```


<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="Visualizations/NetFrequencies/index.html">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Visualizations/NetFrequencies/style.css"  />
<script src="Visualizations/NetFrequencies/flourish.embed.js"></script></div>
```{r NET, echo=FALSE,  out.height='0.0001%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Net Frequencies Curve'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/blank.png")
```



As it was predicted, in late March and early April it is visible a rise in frequencies increased, being especially noticeable on March 29. Even though the same day it can be seen there is a cancellation of 8 K frequencies. This can be somehow confusing, it is for this reason in the next lines is explained the reason found. 

The commercial scheduling consists of planning the destination, timings and frequencies to be flown by the airlines, being one of the key elements when defining their strategy. Commercial scheduling typically undergoes two major iterations per year: the summer and winter schedules. This year, in the northern hemisphere, the summer schedules go from March 29 to October 24. It is because of that, March 29 is an important date. 

In consequence, and considering this analysis is done in the last months of the winter schedule 2020, there have been collected several airlines' summer schedules publications. These have been added to the database and classified as *increases of frequencies*, since there was neither the evidence that the airlines were flying those routes nor the frequencies detailed. This may explain the increase of frequencies visible in both, the map and in the Net Frequencies graphic. However, it is important to highlight the summer schedules published showed a huge reduction of flights compared to previous years. KLM for example introduced a schedule with 57 destinations, flying only the 10\% of the normal number of flights. [@29MKLM] <br>
But how the rise in cancellations is justified?

During the month of March, several airlines published their summer schedules, most of them, with significantly fewer routes and frequencies. Despite its predictions of low demand, they could not forestall the pandemic evolution or the measures the governments will be taking. It is because of that, some of them have been almost adjusting their schedules on a daily basis.

During the month of March, the world's airlines could see how the outbreak in China began to ease and the government started to lift some restrictions. [@ChinaMarch] <br> Air carries reaction was the increase their frequencies, especially those programmed for the summer schedule. 
This rapidly changed on March 26, after the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) decided to limit the number of international flights coming in and out of China. This was a measure taken to resolutely contain the increasing risks of imported COVID-19 cases.
Under this new regulation, starting on March 29, Chinese airlines were only allowed to maintain one route per country and were forced to limit the number of flights to one per week. Foreign airlines were also forced to reduce their international routes to China to one per week and operate only one route into the country [@China29]. The airlines that were some days before adding frequencies are now forced to reduce them again. 

This could explain the rise in canceled frequencies, but in addition, it has to be considered the schedule adjustments applied by airlines for other independent reasons (strategy, new demand predictions, ... ). And at last but not least, it must take into other governments' measures. An example is Oman, which suspends the international and domestic flights on March 29.

All these factors could explain the increase of frequencies in late March/early April. However, there may be factors or considerations not taken into account due to the complexity of the analysis. One of them has been identified and it is explained in detail in the next section.


```{r space, echo=FALSE,  out.height='0.0001%', fig.align='center'}

```

### The air cargo phenomenon {#ImpAn2}

In the previous analysis, it has been seen that during the month of March and particularly when the global pandemic was declared, almost every airline of the world had reduced its flights. 
With the travel restrictions, border closures and quarantine periods, the demand for long-haul or international flights rapidly decreased, being quickly
removed from airline schedules. The air cargo problem starts here. 

Nearly every intercontinental passenger flight, in the belly hold, transports cargo. Before COVID-19, the 45\% of the world air cargo was transported by this way. [@CargoDataa] <br>
With the flight cancellations, the overall air cargo capacity was reduced a 23\% in middle March and around a 40\% in late March, as represented in the next Figure:

```{r AirCapacity, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center',fig.cap='Air Cargo volume and capacity during the months of March, April and May. Source: CLIVE Data Services'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Cargo/AirCapacity.png")

```
Seen how the supply behaved, now is analyzed the demand. <br>
As commented, the economic impact induced for the COVID-19 has been devastating. In March, with almost all the world placed under lockdown, the economic forecast sunk.
With the population under lockdown and the bad economic forecasts, consumers start buying less which generated a knock-on effect where the shipping was always affected. In addition, in many places the factories were shut down, cutting the supply chains. The scenario for air cargo was terrible. Fortuately, it resulted to be another perspective.

It became clear almost since the beginning of coronavirus that SARS-CoV-2 was a hihgly contagius virus. With this, the necessity of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to treat safely the infected patients became essential. This is a material the hospitals have in stock, but not in the quantity needed to protect nearly every staff member for a long period. 

By early March, the pandemic in China started to be controlled and with this, the industries began to starting up their engines again. It is not surprising that China resulted to be the main manufacturer of facial masks of the world. The most demanded equipment at that moment. <br>
Meanwhile, in Europe and the United States the COVID-19 was spreading rapidly, forcing many hospitals to reuse masks. However, even with this technique, they will rapidly need supply. 

In logistics, there is nothing faster than air cargo. The demand of PPE and other medical supplied provoked that the demand of air cargo fell only a 15\% in March 2020, as stated in [@CargoDataa2]. On the other side, as previously said, air capacity dropped around 23\%. This gerated a gap between supply and demand of 8\%. As expected, the economy followed their laws and in late March the air cargo rates increased. In response, the big air cargo airlines that could, rapidly increased their flights. However, the response of cargo airlines is limited to the number of pilots, mechanics and planes they have, being impossible to increase their operations in such a short time.
Here is where passenger airlines appear on the scene.


The passenger airlines had the extra capacity demanded. As stated in [@CargoDataa3], in average passenger airline earns 75\% of its revenues from passengers, the 15\% from cargo and the other 10\% from other transport-related services. It has to be considered that most of the cargo is carried on long-haul flights and that these, in an average airline, are much less than the short-haul. In consequence, the revenues coming from cargo in long-haul flights are much higher. Moreover, the space before occupied by the baggage was now empty. The airlines soon realized the gap in the market and the possibility of making profit through filling their passenger airplanes with cargo.<br>
In addition, other circumstances stimulated this transformation. <br>
One the top of them is the Russia-Saudi Arabia oil price war. The two countries have long worked together limiting the oil output based on demand. But after Russia refused to reduce their output, Saudi Arabia triggered the war by increasing production and slashing the prices. [@CargoProblem] 

```{r Oil, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Oil price evolution during the first quarter of 2020. Source: Refinitiv'  }
knitr::include_graphics("images/Cargo/Oil.png")

```
Considering fuel is the main airlines' cost, the massive drop in its price drastically reduced the operation cost of a flight. This means that airlines needed to earn a lot less than cargo airlines do normally, to make a profit. 
With no passengers airlines did not take to long to innovate, and rapidly filled their passenger cabins with cargo, fastening the goods in the seats or even removing the seats. In fact, Airbus offered a service to the airlines to transform the passenger cabins into an additional hold. This service was available for the A330 and A350 families and included the administrative management with the European Aviation Safety Agency and the return to the passenger configuration. [@AirbusCargo]

```
</div>
```{r space25, echo=FALSE,  out.height='0.0001%', fig.align='center',}
knitr::include_graphics("images/blank.png")
```


All these conditions together made possible that the airlines could generate profits flying passenger planes without passengers. This opportunity was taken by several airlines around the world. For instance, Delta Airlines, Wizz, Air Canda but also small airlines got in on the game, for example, Air Greenland.

The increment in frequencies seen in this study in late March and early April could be partially explained by this phenomenon. In order to verfy or deny the previous hypotesis, there have been listed all the airlines of the database that applied increases in late March/early April. Moreover, each carrier has been classified with a YES or NO considering whether, from March 15 to April 7, there is certainty by the news that they did cargo flights with passenger airplanes. <br>
It is important to mention that some of the airlines listed with a "NO" also did cargo flights with passenger aircrafts, but out of the period studied.


```{r Cargo, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE }
library(readr)
library(kableExtra)
Cargo <- read_csv2("Data/Cargo.csv")

knitr::kable(Cargo[1:80,1:3], align = 'c', caption = "Classification of the airlines that applied increases in frequencies from March 15 to April 7. ") %>%
    kable_styling(font_size = 12) %>%
    scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")
```



From the airlines listed, 32 out of 80 flew cargo flights in their passenger planes, from March 15 to April 7. This represents that 4677 out of 7967, or the 59\% of the increased frequencies could be added for cargo reasons. Although this cannot be ensured, this possibility, together with the argumentation given in the previous section, may explain the frequency increase seen in the Figure \@ref(fig:NET). 


### Evolution of the frequencies canceled per airline {#ImpAn3}

In the following section is studied how the evolution of the erased frequencies per airline is related to the spreading of the pandemic. In order to do so, below are attached the following two illustrations:



<div class="column-left">

```
</div>
```{r Legend, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%',out.height='80%', fig.align='center', }
knitr::include_graphics("images/Legend2.png")

```


On the left side animation is represented the evolution of the frequencies canceled per airline and per day. Meanwhile, in the right graphic is shown the evolution of cases per country^[The data required to design the graphic has been obtained from @DataCountries .] and per day.<br>
In both animations, the bars have been colored considering the *United Nations Statistics Division* (UNSD) regions. By this way, the classification of the airlines has been done taking into account the country where they are based in. For instance, Cathay Dragon has been categorized as "Eastern Asia", since it is a Hong Kong-based airline. In addition, on the bottom of the animations are plotted: <br>
On one side, the total of canceled frequencies per region and on the other side, the total confirmed cases per region.


As represented, in China on January 22  there were already more than 500 positive cases. And Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States reported their first cases. During the next 30 days, it is visible how the virus spreads rapidly inside China. In this stage, the airlines canceling more frequencies are all based in Asia. There are few exceptions like Lufthansa, AirFrance and America's 'Big Three'^[American Airlines, Delta Airlines and United Airlines.]. All these have long-haul routes to China, which are forced to cancel as the coronavirus spreads and fears mount. [@NewsUnited] <br>
From February 19, is illustrated the virus spreading acceleration outside China. In just 5 five days South Korea has 920 more confirmed cases, Italy 258, Japan 67 and Iran 71. Until March 9, the rise of cases in South Korea is followed by an increase of canceled frequencies by Korean Air, which even ranks as the 4th airline with more frequencies canceled.

In late February and early March, the virus is also spreading fiercely in Italy and Iran, surpassing South Korea in cases on March 10. With this, first color changes start arriving in the airlines graphic. On March 7, three European airlines appear in the top 20: Lufthansa, Eurowings and Alitalia. On 8 March, when the North of Italy is placed under quarantine Alitalia shows 736 routes canceled. Two days after, the Italian government places all the country under lockdown, and the  cancellations by the Eruopean airlines rise again. The British low-cost airline, EasyJet, cancels more than 1 K routes from/to Italy to/from Europe.<br>
On March 11, it is declared the global pandemic, Ryanair cancels more than 2 K frequencies and Trump announces the travel ban from Europe starting on March 13.

On March 13, Americas' *"Big Three"* cancel more than 800 frequencies from Europe.
In the next days, Europe becomes the epicenter of the pandemic and on March 16, six out of the ten most-affected countries are European. An example is Spain, where confirmed cases more than triple in just 6 days. 
One of the major changes in the airlines' illustration arrives on March 14, when Lufthansa Group  (Lufthansa, Eurowings, SWISS and Brussels Airlines) cancels more than 5 K frequencies. By March 20, the group will be grounding 700 out of 763 aircraft, flying only the 5\% of its program. [@LufthansaGroup20M]

Meanwhile, in the evolution of the confirmed cases, on March 20 China is still in the first place. Nevertheless, it seems the country has managed to flatten the curve. In the second place is located Italy, where each day is added 2 K cases. Followed by Spain, also confirming around 2 K new cases per day. 

In the next 7 days, a lot of airlines fill new cancellations. It is important to highlight the emerge of South American airlines in the lower part of the ranking. 
South America will be the last region to be hit by the virus and is in mid/late March when the cancellations start taking place. This is also visible in the right graphic, from March 21 to March 31, the cases in Brazil raises from 1 K to 6 K 

However, the virus is now spreading more aggressively in Northern America. The United States, which had 3 K positives on March 15, has more than 100 K confirmed cases and ranks as the most hit country on March 27. Even though, the European and Asian airlines are still the ones that have canceled more frequencies.

During the last stage of this study, from March 27 to April 7, the number of cases keeps increasing. In Germany, for example, on April 4 the reported cases surpassed those reported by China. In the United States the cases more than triple in just 10 days. <br>
In the left graphic, there are no major changes apart from another increase by the Lufthansa Group on April 5. 


The animations conclude on April 7 showing that 6 out of the 10 most hit countries are European, summing up more than 450 K confirmed cases together.
Meanwhile, the United States is now the most hit country surpassing the 360 K cases and China is in the 5th position with 82 K positives.

Regarding the air carriers, the European airlines are the ones that have reduced more frequencies. Lufthansa is in the first position and all the members of its group are in the top 10. 
The low-cost airline Ryanair is also in this ranking, with more than 2 K frequencies canceled.
It is important to notice that there is none Northen American airline in the top 10. American Airlines and United Airlines rank as the 19th and the 20th respectively. This could be explained since the period of time studied concludes on April 7, being likely the most restrictive schedule adjustments were applied after. 

Finally, there are 5 Asian airlines in the top 10. Two of them from the Persian Gulf (Western Asia): Emirates Airlines and Qatar Airway, two from the Southeastern Asia: Air Asia and Cebu Pacific and one from the Eastern Asia: Air China.

In conclusion, it has been found a direct relationship between the number of cases per region and the airlines canceling more frequencies. It has been visible that in late January and early March, when the most affected region was Asia, the airlines reducing more frequencies were based in this region. Moreover, when South Korea raised in positives the flag carrier of the country also increased its cancellations. This same behavior has been followed by Italy and its main airline Alitalia. 
Nevertheless, after the outbreak in Italy and with the virus spreading Europe no more direct relationships between countries and flag-carriers have been detected. The virus was no more focused on one country, being a reality around Europe and with all countries applying measures most of the European carriers were affected. Moreover, the European market is shared among several European airlines, difficulting, even more, the visualization of the countries' affectation through their flag-carriers. This is likely to be the reason for not seeing any specific behavior, although, the relationship between airlines-region is still present.

It has been also noticeable the North-American airlines' reaction to the travel ban from Europe. It is important to highlight, at the moment the decision was taken were around 1 K confirmed cases in the States. So this is clearly a reaction to a government measure rather than the number of cases.

In any case, even in Asia and Europe, where it has been seen a direct relationship between the cases per country and the number of canceled frequencies by the flag-carrier; it cannot be ensured that the airlines where reacting to the value of the confirmed cases. There are more likely to be reactions in front of government measures and drops in demand, rather than the number of COVID-19 positives. 
This can be corroborated with the analysis done in the Section \@ref(ImpAn1), where are explained the government measures and is seen the airlines' reaction. However, it does exist a direct relationship between the number of cases, the government measures and the drop in demand, which all togehter have generated the frequencies cancellation.



### Affected Airlines {#ImpAn4}

In the next section are presented the airlines appearing in the study. This means that the air carriers followingly presented have applied some adjustments in their schedules that have been collected in the database. 
This does not mean other airlines have not introduced adjustments in their schedules, but these have not been listed in *AirlineRoutes*. Besides, it is likely that the database does not gather all the adjustments applied by the airlines listed. This will confirmed through the following analysis.

Below is attached the list of airlines collected in the database:

- __*N^º^ of the potential Frequencies*__: It represents the sum of the frequencies scheduled from January 23 to April 7 by the airline. It does not necessarily represent the total of the frequencies flown by an airline. It is the sum of the frequencies planned initially for the routes adjusted. 

- __*Frequencies Cancelled VS Frequencies Increased*__: It represents the sum of the frequencies canceled against the sum of the frequencies increased from January 23 to April 7 by the airline.

- __*Affectation*__: It is the percentage of the routes canceled for every hundred planned. 


The main objective of this section is to identify those airlines present in the database but whose adjustments have not been completely collected.

On one hand, this can be checked by analyzing the *Frequencies Cancelled VS Increased* color bar. It is unlikely that during the period of the study, an airline has increased more frequencies than canceled. Some of them are: Condor, KLM, Iberia, Finnair, Icelandair, among others.

On the other hand, the low affectation grade may also indicate a lack of information. As it can be seen, there are some airlines that have canceled just a few frequencies or even none. Considering the overall affectations, this is a clear sign there have been adjustments not included. Some of the airlines in question are:  Air Austral, Druk Air, Western Airways, Gol, Azul or Vueling among others. 

Taking Norwegian, for instance, through the database represents that the airline has added 191 frequencies and that it has not canceled any frequency. However, as states in its webpage the airline, by March 16, canceled 85\% of its flights. Another clear example is Vueling. In the database generated the airline lists with an affectation of 0\%, increasing 110 frequencies and canceling none. Nevertheless, by early March the airline already canceled 22 routes from Barcelona [@Vueling].

It is also interesting to explain the case of Neos Airline. As visible, the airline shows 4 frequencies adjusted during the period but neither have been canceled nor increased. The adjustments gathered from Neos have been all from the type 4 - "Closed for reservation". However, in its webpage is listed all the destinations with flights suspended. 

Finally, there are some airlines listing a low N^º^ of frequencies planned. These carriers either may be small or only a few adjustments have been collected. Considering the particularly low value in some cases, it is more likely to be once again a lack of adjustments. Some example are: Aerolineas Argentinas, Azerbaijan Airlines, Air Mauritius, Yakutia, Edelweiss Air, ...

 
As seen, it cannot be ensured for a lot of airlines to have listed all their adjustments. But not only that, even for the ones that accomplish the requisites stated before, it cannot be guaranteed to have all their adjustments. 
If further analysis focus on specific airlines there may be reached false conclusions. It is for this reason, the analysis of the next sections are carried out under an overall point of view. 


To continue, there are presented the following two Figures: 

<div class="column-left">

<script src="Visualizations/AffectedAirlinesRegion/flourish.embed.js"></script></div>
```{r NAirAff, echo=FALSE,  out.height='0.0001%', fig.align='center',fig.cap='Number of Airlines Affected per Region'}

```
</div>
<div class="column-right">

<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="Visualizations/CancellationsRegion/index.html">

```
</div>

```{r Legend2, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%',out.height='80%', fig.align='center', }
knitr::include_graphics("images/Legend2.png")

```

As shown in the left circle, 114 of the airlines listed are from Asia, representing 48.8\% of the total. The 25.2\% are from Europe, summing up 62 airlines. Northern America airlines represents the 5.3\%, Southern America and the Caribbean the 6.1\%, Africa the 7.8\% and Oceania the 6.8\%. <br>
Since the period selected gathers the evolution of the pandemic mainly in Asia and Europe, this is the result expected. <br>
There have been seen some of measures applied in America, and the airlines' response. However, it was in mid/late April when America was most hit by COVID-19. Then, it is expected that extending the period would make visible an increase in the number of America's airlines, as well as, in their number of frequencies canceled.

The number of airlines introducing adjustments does not necessarily mean, more frequencies canceled. It is because of that, it is necessary to check the right graphic.

As visible, Western Europe has been the region in which it has been canceled more frequencies, representing the 26\% of the total. The reason behind is the massive cut of Lufthansa Group, who have been flying only the 5\% of its usual program. This may explain the noticeable difference between Western Europe and the other regions. However, this does not mean that other airlines did not also apply a massive cuts but there may not be listed. 

Western Europe is followed by Eastern, Southeastern and Western Asia that together respresent up to 46\% of the cancellations. This is also an expected result, considering the period studied gathers the pandemic evolution in the Asian territory.

Northern America represents almost the 7\% of the cancellations. This is mainly explained by the travel ban from Europe. Even though, and as it has been commented, it is expected this value would increase if the period was extended until late April. 

The other regions of Europe (Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe) represent the 12% of the total cancellations, almost a quarter part of Western Europe. This also indicates the database is incomplete. It is known that airlines of these regions have also applied important cuts in their schedules. Are some examples: The Irish low-cost, Ryanair, grounded its entire fleet from March 24 to April 9. The Spanish long-haul low-cost airline, LEVEL grounded also its entire fleet on March 20. Or the English easyJet, which also grounded its fleet on March 25^[This information has been obtained from [@Cuts], the percentages cited are for time-periods enclosed in the period of this study.].





### Duration and anticipation of the adjustements {#ImpAn5}

In this section will be studied the duration and the anticipation of the adjustments applied by the airlines.

Firstly, it is analysed how the duration of the adjustments has evolved throughout the period. This parameter has been calculated counting the number of days between the ending date and the starting date of the adjustment (See Table \@ref(tab:Example)) and dividing the value by 7 to have the parameter in terms of weeks. After this, it has been calculated the average for all the adjustments published on the same date, obtaining the curve in <span style="color:darkblue">blue</span>:

<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="Visualizations/Duration/index.html">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Visualizations/Duration/style.css"  />
<script src="Visualizations/Duration/flourish.embed.js"></script></div>
```{r Duration, echo=FALSE,  out.height='0.0001%', fig.align='center',fig.cap='Evolution of the average duration of the adjustments.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/blank.png")
```
As represented, the parameter has fluctuated during the entire period, without any evident pattern at plain sight. 
It has also been checked whether there is a relationship between the pick-values and the weekdays. However, it has not been found any pattern that could explain the fluctuation of the curve. 
It can be seen, through the trend-line plotted, the average duration of the adjustments has reduced over time. Airlines in late January/early February were modifying their schedules for around 6 weeks on average. Two months later in early April, the adjustments have a duration of around 3 and a half weeks. <br>
The overall behavior is to decrease, even though, it is true in mid-March the tendency changes, and the duration seems to increase. This may be explained by the arrival of the pandemic in Europe. The European governments start announcing the lockdown of its countries for periods of 3/4 weeks. In response, the airlines applied adjustments for 4/5 weeks in their schedules. Later-on though, the lockdowns were extended and the airlines had to introduce new adjustments. 


Following, it is studied the evolution of the adjustments' anticipation.  This parameter has been calculated counting the number of days between the publication date and the starting date of the adjustment (See Table: \@ref(tab:Example)) and dividing by 7 to have the parameter in terms of weeks. After this, it has been done the average of all the adjustments published on the same date, obtaining the curve in <span style="color:darkblue">blue</span>:

<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="Visualizations/Anticipation/index.html">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Visualizations/Anticipation/style.css"  />
<script src="Visualizations/Anticipation/flourish.embed.js"></script></div>
```{r Anticipation, echo=FALSE,  out.height='0.0001%', fig.align='center',fig.cap='Evolution of the average anticipation of the adjustments.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/blank.png")
```

As visible, the anticipation fluctuates like the duration. There is not any evident patter at plain sight, even though, it can be seen there are several days the parameter takes values near zero or even zero. This means the airlines canceled flights for the same day. These days are:

- January 23: The city of Wuhan is placed under lockdown.

- February 13: -

- February 16: -

- March 8: Italy announces the expansion of the quarantine zone to cover much of northern Italy.


On January 23 and March 8 the lack of anticipation can be explained by the government measures imposed, which arrived by surprise. Meanwhile, on February 13 and February 16 no governments' measures were found to explain this behavior. However, it may be explained considering how the data collection has been done. 

Let us assume an adjustment of Iberia having an ending date in late February. By mid-February, the airline is aware that the lockdown of a country has been prolonged. In front of this, Iberia decides to extend its routes cancellations until mid-March and introduces a new adjustment. The starting date of this modification will be the same as the publication date. In other words, the anticipation will be null. <br> Therefore, if one day the adjustments introduced are all or mostly extensions, the average of the anticipation parameter will decrease. This may explain the low values seen in the graphic.

On the other side, there are some days with considerable spike values.
After some research, it has not been found any relationship with external events to justify these unusual increases. However, once again may be explained by the way that data has been collected. For example on February 10, the value rises due to several adjustments introduced by China Southern extending its cancellations duration. 
China Southern's first adjustments were planned to end on March 29. However, the airline, on February 10, decided to extend them until mid-April. Considering the starting date of the new adjustment corresponds to the ending date of the modified adjustment, the new anticipation value is almost of 7 weeks. 

As noticeable, these extensions do not follow the same criteria of the Iberia example when setting the starting date. This high dependency on airlines' adjustments, and in the way that have been collected explains the fluctuation of the parameter. It is because of that, the interpretation of this graphic has to be more focused on the overall behavior rather than on specific days. 

Analyzing the full picture, and taking advantage of the trendline, it is visible the anticipation value has increased along the period. Notwithstanding, this has been smooth, going from almost 0.5 weeks to 0.9 weeks of anticipation. The fact that the value raises could be explained by the element of surprise. As time went by, airlines had more time to elaborate their demand studies and understand the situation, hence they could plan ahead their adjustments, increasing the average anticipation. <br>
As mentioned though, the increase has been very soft. The preventive measures, the drops in demand, and the travel bans have arrived in a staggered way. Airlines have been continuously adapting to a new situation, being very difficult to anticipate to the virus consequences. This clearly explains the high fluctuation of both curves.

Finally, no further conclusions can be reached from the animations.  In both cases, it has been seen a high dependency on the dates and in consequence on the number of publications. 
Once again, not knowing if the database is completed hinders the differentiation of the important events from particular cases. Moreover, the fact that the airlines' adjustments do not always follow the same criteria when defining the starting date makes it even more complicated.   

### Airlines' Strategy {#ImpAn6}

The aviation industry has already faced pandemics in the past. In 2003, because of the SARS outbreak, airlines from around the globe saw a decline in traffic with those operating out of Asia Pacific losing as much as 8\% on an annual basis. For those airlines, the outbreak cost 6 billion dollars in revenue. For the North American 1 billion dollars. SARS was also a very contagious virus, however, it took 8 months to contain the virus. A rapid response, together with a dose of luck from the seasonal change made possible the stop of the spreading. [@Sars] 

But when COVID-19 outbreak started it became clear it would be really difficult to repeat the feat lived with the SARS outbreak. The travel industry has made the world more interconnected than in 2003, accelerating the rate of infection. China, the starting point of both viruses, has become the world's largest outbound in tourism. Besides,  the global airline capacity into China is now more than 3.5 times larger than in 2005. Airlines and its flights have played an essential role in the spreading. It is for this reason that the travel ban has been one of the first measures announced by the governments. 

Understood the role of passenger airlines, and gathering all the results seen in the previous sections, in the next lines is pretended to layout the strategy followed by the airlines in front of the pandemic. Or in other words, what have airlines done to keep alive? 

As it has been seen, the pandemic outbreak can be explained by the representation of the cancellation routes. However, the cancellations did not arise from the number of cases but in response to the government measures. 

Temperature sensors or the recommendation to avoid non-essential travel were the first measures introduced by the governments.  A few days were enough to prove there were inefficient.  In the infected countries the confirmed cases continued to increase and in those, until that moment free of COVID-19, the first cases started to arise. Since tourism represents the 10.3\% of the global GPD, the travel ban was a measure not taken lightly. Firstly, the travel ban was only applied to those countries or regions with more cases, but the virus was already present worldwide and the measure was insufficient. In front of this, governments progressively were forced to lockdown their citizens and finally close their borders.

It is not difficult to imagine the major impact these have on the economy of a country, it is for this reason that in gerenal, these were taken when no alternatives were feasible. Or in other words, when the number of confirmed cases inside the country was already critical.   

The world was put under lockdown progressively and with it, the number of planes grounded. As said before, airlines did not stop flying because of the rise of cases but when it was forbidden to fly. In fact, in the first stages of the outbreak, when only was banned to fly to/from China but the virus was already spreading, airlines from the rest of the world were still taking off, just fulfilling a list of health measures and recommendations issued by IATA.  

However, with the outbreak collapsing the media, people start being afraid and the air travel demand dropped. Airlines not only were facing flight restrictions in more countries but in the rest, they were suffering from low demand. In Europe, almost every airline start experiencing net negative booking: There were refounding more bookings than they had coming in. <br>
Airlines rapidly predict the lack of liquidity that they would have to face. Under the author point of view, airlines have flown until the regulations or demand has allowed it, cancelling the unprofitable frequencies and the routes affected by government restrictions. 

Interestingly, this gradual slowdown has revealed two interesting phenomena. 
The first is that airlines have waited as much as they could to cancel their flights. This has been reported by a lot of costumers including the author of this project.<br>
In a pre-coronavirus era, airline flight schedules would be typically fixed a couple of months before the departure. Only the weather conditions, mechanical issues, or other unforeseen circumstances could modify the schedule of an airline it the last moment.  With so much uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, this is not happening anymore. Airlines are constantly adjusting their route networks and there are some reasons that explains it.

With their schedules in the air, it is much easier for the airlines to have a clear picture of their daily operations and demand.
In addition, by waiting to cancel flights it is a practice that has proven to be profitable. Anxious people that make voluntary changes before their flight is canceled, even sometimes having to pay, aren't eligible for refunds later on when the airline inevitably cancels the flight. [@LastMinuteCancel] <br> Moreover, to encourage more eager people, almost every airline has removed their change fees, trying to avoid as much as they could the refunds. A sign that could indicate that a flight is going to be canceled is to check its availability for reservation. Airlines prior to the cancelation, usually close the possibility to make new bookings, this way, there will have less work rebooking passengers when the flight ends up getting axed. This may explain the rise in routes closed for reservation seen in the map at the beginning of the pandemic. 

When a flight is canceled the airline must offer the choice to the passsenger of a refund or a voucher of the same value to use in an alternative flight. The decision has to be taken by the customer. During the COVID-19 though, airlines predicted the lack of liquidity they will face. To avoid it, some airlines decided only to offer the possibility to their costumers to get a voucher. 
This allowed the airlines to preserve cash and ensure the passenger will fly again in the future. However, these companies now face a complaint from *Facua-Consumidores en Acción* to the EASA for breach of regulations. The airlines in question are Air Europa, KLM, Latam Airlines, Lufthansa, Transavia, United Airlines, Vueling y Air France. [@AerolinesDenunciades]

Other airlines did offer the possibility to their passengers to get a refund, however, they are receiving such a volume of petitions that a lot of costumers have not got their money back yet. For example, Ryanair.

Other airlines, like Wizz Air, have promoted the vouchers. The airline has offered vouchers with a value of 120\% of the reservation price.  A good strategy, in compliance with the normative that allows to preserve cash, have the costumer satisfyed and even sometimes earn more cash in new reservations.  

As we mentioned before, the tourism industry has a major role in the global economy. Some countries' economy depends on tourism, for others, it represents a huge income. Airlines not only play an essential role in tourism, but the flag carriers represent the wealth of its country. It is for this reason, the governments have spended billions of dolars to keep their airlies afloat. 
It is not a proper strategy element, but the government's economic help has allowed the airlines to avoid, temporarily, the lay off of their employes. However, not all the airlines have received the same support, those in developing countries are the ones in major danger. 

Another measure that has helped the industry is the announcement of the European Commission *"to put forward targeted legislation to temporarily alleviate airlines from their airport slot usage obligations under EU law"* @EuropeanComision. This regulation was forcing the airlines to use at least 80% of their takeoff and landing airport slots in order to keep their schedules for the next year. Its temporary suspension, on March 30, has let airlines to do not waste thousands of litres of fuel to fly “ghost planes” with no passengers, simply to maintain their slots. 

Finally, with the government restrictions closing the world's airspace some airlines found shelter in the repatriation flights. However, these were rapidly over and they had to found another alternatives. As seen, this resulted to be the cargo flights. Most of the big international airlines reinvented themselves and converted their biggest planes into cargo planes. Either placing packages in the seats or even removing them, passenger airlines found a way to generate profits flying passenger planes without passengers.

As can be seen, it has not been studied the strategies followed by any airline in particular. It cannot be ensured that the database gathers all the schedule adjustments. Furthermore, although most of the cancellations are explained by the imposition of lockdowns, others are due to the drop in demand.  What factors have airlines considered? How the demand has been forecast? What routes have been canceled for this reason? These are questions with unknown answers.<br> 
Therefore, and because of false conclusions could be reached, this analysis has been discarded. However, this has been left aside to become one of the main motivations to continue this project.

# The Scenarios for the Future of the Air Transport  {#Fore}

In the beginning of this project, it has been explained the forecast for the aviation industry before the COVID-19 arrival. Following, it has been seen the impact on the aviation industry under a routes point of view. Finally, the last step consists in quantifying the economic impact and visualize, still inside the pandemic, the scenarios that are most likely to explain the future of the industry. 

As of June 8, the latest estimations published by ICAO show that the COVID-19 impact would generate an overall reduction between 40\% to 53\% of the seats offered by airlines, with an overall reduction of 2.2 to 3 billion passengers for the full year 2020. This will cause a loss between 300 to 400 billion dollars. Of course, these estimations depend on the duration of the outbreak, the confidence of the costumers to travel again and the economic conditions. 

As @ForbesForecast details in the Editors' Pick of Forbes magazine,
*"Many nations have closed their borders to prevent the spread of the disease today and will probably continue to regard foreign travel with far more suspicion than domestic travel. Western governments also will find it harder to restrict domestic travel volumes than international volumes. For similar reasons, customer confidence in international flying will return more slowly than for domestic flights.  Finally, bigger planes have higher trip costs and create more economic risk when demand is depressed. Expect volume to return slowest in international long-haul, especially segments that extra-long-range narrow bodies can’t handle"*.

It is not surprising that the forecasts for international traffic are more pessimistic than domestic traffic.

```{r ForeCastDrop, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(kableExtra)
ForecastDrop <- read_csv2("Data/ForecastDrop.csv")
knitr::kable(ForecastDrop,align = "c", caption = "Drop forecast for international and domestic passenger traffic.") %>%
    kable_styling(font_size = 12)
```

From January to May, approximately there have been loss around 130 billion USD dolars in passengers revenue. As ICAO estimates, the most affected regions have been: Asia/Pacific, Europe and North America respectively.

```{r LossRegions, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Passenger Revenue Loss per region. Source: ICAO'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Forecast/RegionsLoss.png")
```

It was clear from the very beginning COVID-19 would mark a milestone. In fact, the impact of COVID-19, as of June 8, has surpassed by far that generated by SARS-2003, which resulted in a reduction of 6 billion dollars in revenues for Asia/Pacific airlines. 
As ICAO states, is day by day more clear that *"the 6 month recovery path of SARS-2003 might not apply to today's situation"*. There is no doubt though, there are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the current situation. How much more the pandemic and the lockdowns will last? How deep will the global recession be? These are just a couple of questions without answers that will highly influence the sector. However, and as was mentioned in the beginning of the project, the aviation industry is characterized for cyclicality. Air transport will recover, the unknown is in what shape. [@ICAOEcoImpact]

The informal classification to describe different types of recessions is:

- V-shaped: The most common shape for a recession. The economy suffers a clearly defined sharp and brief period of decline followed by a quick recovery. 

- U-shaped: This type of recession is less-clear that V-shape recession and longer. It has a more prolonger contraction and a smoother recovery.

- W-shaped: Also known as double-dip, it represents a fall into recession, followed by a short period of recovery, then falls back into recession before finally recovering. 

- L-shaped: This shape occurs when an economy has a deep recession and does not return to the previous trend line for many years. 

- “Nike swoosh”-shaped or Tick Shape: Similar to the V-shaped but with a more gradual, but still aggressive recovery.

This can be applied to the seat capacity supply:

```{r Shapes, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Scenarios for passenger seat capacity. Source: ICAO'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Forecast/Shapes.png")
```

In the first stages of the outbreak, there was the economic consensus the recession would be V-shaped. In fact, the reason why airlines did not lay off in mass their pilots, mechanics or suppliers is because it was expected there would be a need for them shortly after the pandemic subsides. Governments have spent billions of dollars to maintain their airlines afloat, allowing them to apply temporary lays off until the repressed demand raised again. However, this has resulted to be a utopia.

What in the beginning was predicted to be a V is now expected to be more like a U, L or "Nike Swoosh". The recent corporate announcements in late April/early March are fading the V-shape scenario. The low cost, Norwegian on April 27 warned that virtually most of its fleet of aircraft will be grounded until 2021 [@Norwegian2021]. Meanwhile, British Airways announced on April 28 its plans to lay off 12 K employees and announced it would take several years to return to last year's passenger levels [@BALayOff]. Also, Ryanair announced on May 1, 3 K jobs cut as COVID-19 continued to batter the travel industry [@Nuggets]. An like these, several airlines around the world.


As director-general of IATA, Alexandre de Junaic, said: *“The industry’s outlook grows darker by the day. The scale of the crisis makes a sharp V-shaped recovery unlikely. Realistically, it will be a U-shaped recovery with domestic travel coming back faster than the international market"* [@TheStar].
Others, like Delta Air Line CEO Ed Bestian thinks the recovery in air demand will probably be shaped more like the Nike "Swoosh" logo. Even though, all of them agree that there will be necessary between 3 to 5 years to reach the pre-COVID expectations.


The outbreak has forced almost everyone to readapt, working by remote meeting is now an extended practice. This will highly affect busniess travel,  which will be limited to meet essential needs. <br>

Leisure passengers, as their confidence and economic wealth increase, are expected to be very cautious in booking new flights. As
<a href="https://ideaworkscompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Flight-Plan-2020-How-Travel-Will-Be-Different-2.pdf">*IdeaWorksCompany.com*</a> cites in its report: *Costumers spending will be fragile and will expect low prices. They will assess the overall cost of a trip to include the ticket price, plus all fees, and the hotel rate"* [@IdeaWorks]. 

Airlines will have an essential role in stimulating people to travel. However, as Wizz Air CEO, József Váradi, states *"The problem, by and large, is not people’s intention to travel, but rather the restrictions put in place by governments, which makes things quite unpredictable. During good times, with no state restrictions, we operate in 45 countries. There are currently no two countries of those 45 that have imposed the same restrictions. The whole process has become totally uncoordinated, it's quite a mess and it makes it very hard for people to look past these issues, of how they can leave their country, how they can get into another country, and how their movements will be restricted."*<br> 
It will not be only required the effort of the airlines but, the coordination of the countries to help and encourage people to head to the boarding gates.

# Conclusions {#Conc}

Once concluded the analysis, and seen the results obtained, it is considered appropriate to expose some final considerations as final conclusions. 



Firstly, it is important to mention that, before starting with the project one of the first anticipated challenges was to find an open-source from which would be extracted the schedule adjustments. And if spotted, if it would be enough completed to fulfill the objectives of the project. In front of the results obtained, it can be stated that the source found and the resulting database generated have accomplished most of the objectives initially set. 

As explained in the project, most of the adjustments collected respond to governments' measures or to the drops in demand. These actions or scenarios are  directly realted to the number of cases or to the spreading of the virus. Thus, it has been seen almost a direct relationship between the schedules' adjustments and the pandemic evolution, accomplishing one of the project's main objectives. <br>
However, it is important to highlight the proven evidence that the database is uncompleted. Some of the airlines listed have shown, clearly, a lack of accounted modifications. Despite this, in total there have been gathered more than 15 K adjustments from more than 200 different airlines. Almost in every situation, the lack of information from one airline has been countered with the adjustments from another airline. This has not only allowed visualizing the airlines' response to most of the main governments' measures, but it has made possible the global analysis.

It has been also possible to analyze the evolution of the pandemic through the ranking of airlines canceling more frequencies. This has lead to the conclusion that it does exit a temporal relationship between the most affected region and the airlines introducing more cancellations. However, if taken the last day of the study and summing up all the adjustments, it results that the region with more confirmed cases does not correspon to the region where more frequencies have been canceled:

<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="Visualizations/CasesFreq/index.html">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Visualizations/CasesFreq/style.css"  />
<script src="Visualizations/CasesFreq/flourish.embed.js"></script></div>
```{r CasesFreq, echo=FALSE,  out.height='0.0001%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Number of cases per region *vs* number of canceled frequencies.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/blank.png")
```

The regions most hit by COVID-19 have been North America followed by Southern Europe, Western Europe and Eastern Asia. Meanwhile, the regions showing more frequencies cancelations are: Western Europe, Eastern Asia, Southeastern Asia and Western Asia. 

It was expected that the most developed regions would list the majority of the cancelations. The results obtained have followed this hypothesis. However, some regions showcase a considerably low value. A clear example are North America and Southern Europe. This is explained by the period analyzed and the elaboration of the database. <br> 
For North America it is predicted that some adjustments have not been collected. In addtion, some of the major cuts by american airlines were applied out of the period studied. This has generated the low value of cancellations that may not explain the real situation of the region. Regarding Southern Europe, there is evidence that the airlines of the region almost grounded their entire fleet. However, this is not showcased in the graphic, being clear that some adjustments are missing. <br> 

The evolution of the cancelled frequencies per airline has resulted very useful to see how the epicenter of the pandemic changed from China to Europe, but not to visualize the raise of the Unites States. This study then is not appropriate to extract conclusions on what region has seen more frequencies canceled. In order to do so, it is highly recommended to extend the period or/and change the data source. 

Regarding the airlines' strategy, and from an overall point of view, it has been possible to see the airlines' response to most of the government measures listed in the study. It has been very interesting to notice that most of the cancellations arrived the day the measures came into effect. In consequence as an initial assessment, it can be stated airlines have flown until it has been forbidden or until they have been loosing money. <br>
Apart from that, there have to be reminded the cancelations provoked by the successive drops in demand. Since demand is in part a forecast study, it is expected that the resulting cancelations were introduced in advance. However, the inestability and uncertainity of the period, added to the rapid spreading of the virus and the constant aggregation of travel bans have made the anticipation really complicated, even sometimes not possible. This has been represented by the curves of the average anticipation and the duration of the adjustments, which have not shown any specific pattern.


Defining the strategy of a specific airline has been left aside to be fulfilled either in a possible continuity of the study or in a new project. The database generated does not have the enough information to elaborate the study and it may lead to false conclusions.


What it is clear is COVID-19 has led to a totally unprecedented situation in the air travel industry. This project has visualized this scenario by analyzing the frequencies canceled, but another way to approach it is by studying the flights flown. This is showcased in the following video from *South China Morning Post* :

The evolution of the pandemic has left devestating images for the sector. As seen in the video, with the spreading of the virus less planes have taken off. The COVID-19 has promoted all destinations worldwide to introduce travel restrictions. 
As of April 28, the UNWTO webpage states, and quoting verbatim, *"of 217 destinations worldwide:*


- *45% have totally or partially closed their borders for tourists - “Passengers are not allowed to enter”.*

- *30% have suspended totally or partially international flights - “all flights are suspended”.*

- *18% are banning the entry for passengers from specific countries of origin or passengers who have transited through specific destinations.*

- *7% are applying different measures, such as quarantine or self-isolation for 14 days and visa measures."* [@globalban]

In view of the global dimension, it has been considered appropriate to represent the relationship between the confirmed cases and the global travel restrictions for the period studied. In the Figures below are represented:

- On the left side, the spreading of the virus. Each country is coloured depending on the number of confirmed cases. 
- On the right side, the countries' announcement of global travel restrictions. The territories coloured in red have introduced  the totally closure of their borders (*Passengers are not allowed to enter*) or the suspension of all international flights (*All flights are suspended*).

The UNWTO states that COVID-19 has left the most severe restriction on international travel in history. Even though, despite the huge impact seen, the major uncertainty is not knowing when this is going to end. As of June 26, some countries have lifted their travel restrictions, but the new outbreaks in focused areas are threatening and even provoking new lockdowns of entire cities. It is very difficult to forecast when air travel will recover, however and as explained, most experts predict that the levels of 2019 will not be reached, at least, in three years. 

If there is something beyond doubt is the uncertainty now surrounding the sector will continue for the foreseeable future. Everything depends on how fast the pandemic can be contained, how fast the governments around the globe will open their airspace, and how the economy evolves. However, as the political activist George Bernard, said:

*“Both optimists and pessimists contribute to our society. The optimist invents the airplane and the pessimist the parachute.”*

Aviation will prove once again its strength and cyclicality, sooner or later uncertainties will become certainties and the air will be clear. We will fly again.

To conclude, this project has given the practical opportunity to not only to approach to the Air Transport industry, but to study the COVID-19 repercussions. It has been also very interesting to read about experts opinions, strike up conversations with fellow professionals or discuss with the tutors the results obtained.<br> In the end, this study has resulted to be a very rewarding experience, where the challenges have turned into self-improvement objectives.
