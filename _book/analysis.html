<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> The pandemic outbrake throughout the schedule adjustments</h3>
<p>Firstly, it will be determined if the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic can be represented throughout the evolution of the schedules adjustments. To do so, it will be used the following animation, in which are represented the affectations in the routes throughout the period studied.</p>
<p>The schedules modifications have been represented depending on its nature:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <span style="color:red">red</span> are drawn the routes that have been cancelled for some airline.</li>
<li>In <span style="color:purple">purple</span> are represented those routes seeing a reduction in their frequencies.</li>
<li>In <span style="color:green">green</span> represented those routes seeing an increase in their frequencies.</li>
<li>In <span style="color:blue">blue</span> are plot the routes in which some airline have closed the reservation.</li>

</div>
<p>The presentation starts on January 22, being visible the effects of the pandemic just a day after. On January 23 the city of Wuhan is placed under lockdown and with this, the first cancellations arise. Until January 29, it can be seen the affectation takes place mainly at Eastern Asia in a radial form with the epicentre in Wuhan. Even though, some routes from Europe and North-America are being also altered. Some examples are those flown by British, Lufthansa or American airlines to China, from now on cancelled.</p>
<p>On January 30, the WHO (<em>World Health Organization</em>) declares the COVID-19 pandemic a global emergency. China has now reported cases in all its provincial divisions and countries like India and Philippines announce their first positives. Other like France, Italy, Germany or South Korea report new cases. On the same day and the day after of the WHO declaration, it becomes obvious the repercussion the virus will have in the air transport across the globe. The routes affected increase drastically, being now more international rather than domestic. Even tough and as the routes show, the virus is in its majority in Eastern Asia, specifically in China.</p>
<p>As February begins, some countries respond to the global emergency declaration from WHO. A growing number of states start introducing temperature sensors and scanners in their airports. Others like Bahamas, Indonesia, Mauritius or Israel introduce quarantine measures for those arriving from China or suspected of having the virus. This measure will be followed for countries around the globe in the next days. These measures though, are rapidly not enough and the countries proceed to ban the flights from or to China. Some examples are Mauritius and Singapore (February 2), Israel (February 3), Indonesia and Turkey (February 5). Despite the efforts, the virus spread rapidly and more countries are infected during the month. The measures applied for China will be now applied for these.. Even though, this can not be explained through the schedules adjustments. As represented the modifications grow gradually and all around Eastern Asia, being not visible specific travel bans.</p>
<p>However, it is interesting to notice the changes in the nature of adjustments. With the closure of the city of Wuhan, the adjustments in both long-haul and short-haul routes were all cancellations. This behaviour changes on January 31-February 1, when most of long-haul routes modifications are routes closed for reservation. In the next pages, this will be analysed with the aim to determine whether is an anticipation move by European airlines. Meanwhile, Asia short-hauls and China domestic routes adjustments are mainly cancellation or reductions in frequency.</p>
<p>February is also complicated for Europe, Italy will become the third most affected country by the end of the month. In response, some countries introduce travel restrictions for passenger who had been in Italy: Switzerland (February 13), Turkey (February 16), Kuwait (February 20) and Mauritius (February 24) among others. Even though, no major affectations compared to the rest of Europe are visible. It starts to be noticeable on February 28 when El Al (Israel Airlines) cancels all flights to Italy following limitations on travel imposed by the Health and Interior ministries. One day after, on February 29 Italy has more than 1 K confirmed cases and South Korea more than 3 K. This same day the Ministry of Health of Turkey announces the flight suspension to Italy and also to Iraq and South Korea, a measure that can be also seen in the map.</p>
<p>On March 1, the flag carrier of Italy (<em>Alitalia</em>) announces a frequency reduction to most of its domestic routes, clearly visible in the animation. During the next 6 days other airlines will adjust their routes to Italy, even though, there are no significant changes. This changes rapidly on March 8. Italy, which until now had only 10 municipalities of the Lodi province under lockdown, decides to extend the quarantine to the entirely region of Lombardy and 14 regions more of the north of the country. This provokes new affectations in domestic and international routes, mainly from/to Europe. Even though, some long-haul routes from North and South America involving Rome airport are also affected. This is likely to be an anticipation move by the airlines who may predict what is coming: Europe will become the new epicentre of the pandemic.</p>
<p>On March 9, there are no significant changes in the overall scenario. However, one the major airlines around the world, Emirates Airlines files some service changes. It is suffering from low demand caused by the pandemic, deciding to cancel some short-haul routes and idling some A380 of its fleet. One day after, on March 10, Europe tinges red. Italy announces the quarantine of the entire country. Italy is now the second most hit country with more than 10 K cases. Airports that until this day were not affected show now cancelled routes. It is also very importance to notice Spain is also growing fast in cases: With more than 3 K is followed by France with more than 1.5k and Germany with 1.2 K.</p>
<p>On March 11, there are more than 125 K cases around the world and the WHO declares the COVID-19 a global pandemic. More routes to/from Italy are cancelled mainly to/from other European countries and North America. This same day the president of The United States announces travel ban from Schengen Area to the US in bid to stem coronavirus. This measure will go into effect the Friday 13th of March<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, generating a cloud of cancelled routes over the Atlantic sea. From that day the chaos is taking hold of Europe and its countries start proclaiming the state of alarm and the total confinement for their citizens: Portugal on March 13 follwed by Spain the day after. Austria on March 16 and France and Belgium on March 17. Of the last are Poland on March 20 and Greece and the UK on March 23. Until that day it is very complicated to detect the specific reactions since the adjustments are widespread around Europe.</p>
<p>In the north of the African continent, on March 14-March 15 is visible a significant increase of cancelled routes in Algeria and Morocco respectively. The affectations in Algeria are explained by the service cancellation to France by the flag airline, Air Algerie. Meanwhile, in Morocco the adjustments are done by Royal Air Maroc after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that all international passenger flights to and from the country would be suspended.</p>
<p>Back to March 13, in the Arabian peninsula, it can be seen an increase in affected routes, concretely in Kuwait. The reason behind is the total closure of Kuwait International Airport. The government takes this measure with the objective to isolate the country from the rest of the world. Kuwait becomes the first country to close completely its main airport as a preventive measure with 72 positive cases. Two days after, on March 15, Saudi Arabia announces the travel ban from/to the country. The airlines response to this measure is clearly visible, routes cancellations in Jeddah rise immediately.</p>
<p>In Russia, from March 13 and for a undetermined period of time, is limited the air traffic with Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. This measure is represented with an increase of cancelled routes mainly in the Capital Moscow, and in St. Petersburg. Still in the Easter Europe the increase of adjustments is even more substantial on March 16. Russia introduces new limitations and Aeroflot, the flag carrier of the country, introduces new flight reductions in its schedule. In addition, this same day in Uzbekistan the air borders closure come into effect.</p>
<p>Jumping to the southeastern Asia, on March 15, the city of Manila (Philippines) is placed under lockdown, generating a raise in cancellations. This measure is also imposed to the city of Cebu the next day, forcing the flag carrier of the county, Cebu Pacific, to cancel its routes to/from Cebu the March 17. This generates a new raise in cancellations the same day the country is declared under a state of calamity for a tentative period of six months.</p>
<p>On March 17, China is still the country more hit, with 81 K positive cases. Italy presents 30 K and is followed by Spain with 16 K, which has just surpassed Iran. Meanwhile, in the other side of the Atlantic sea, until now with minor affectations, start arriving the first measures. In Peru, with 117 positive cases, come into affect the state of emergency announced the day before suspending all the international air transport of passengers. On March 18 Chile enact the state of alarm and the day after, in the Dominican Republic, President Medina announces the suspension of inbound air. However, this measure cannot be seen in the data collected. Otherwise, on March 23, Colombia forbids the international flights and Panama closes its air borders, centre America tinges red. By that day, in South America, Brazil is the most hit country with more than 1.5 K cases, followed by Ecuador with 850 and Chile 663. The most severe measures in Brazil will arrive on March 30 closing its borders, however, it is not visible any significant affectation.</p>
<p>Crossing again the Atlantic sea and back to March 19, Egypt closes their airports for international flights, being noticeable, specially in Cairo, the increase in adjustments. In the Southeastern Asia, Air Asia Thailand announced the suspension of all its international flights, as well as, the reduction in frequencies for its domestic routes. Both measures come into affect on March 22, being visible in the airport of the country and mainly in the Capital Bangkok.</p>
<p>On March 25 Australia ranks as the 17th most hit country, with 2.7 K cases. This day the country forbids its citizens to leave the country with only few exceptions. This measure provokes a rise in schedule adjustments of those routes involving Australian airports. Three days after, on March 28th, the Malaysian low-costs AirAsia and AirAsia suspend their operations tingeing the skies of the country in red.</p>
<p>Finally, in the last stage of the animation, from March 18 to April 7, some routes that were cancelled or reduced start reopening or showing increments in their frequencies, being specially noticeable in March 29th. As represented in the following Figure, and as it was predicted through the map, airlines start adding a significative number of frequencies from the March 18. However, is not unitl March 27 when the Net Frequency Curves turns positive until April 3. During this period airlines were adding more frequencies than cancelling.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.2</span> Evolution of the frequencies cancelled per airline</h3>
<p>In the following section is studied how the evolution of the erased frequencies per airline is related with the spreading of the pandemic. In order to do so, below are attached the following two illustrations:</p>
<div class="column-left">
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-bar-chart-race" data-src="visualisation/2333144" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/2333144/embed">

</div>
</div>
<p><img src="images/Legend.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>On the left side animation is represented the evolution of the frequencies cancelled per airline and per day. Meanwhile, in the right graphic is shown the evolution of cases per country<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and per day. In both animations the bars have been colored considering the <em>United Nations Statistics Division</em> (UNSD) regions. By this way, the classification of the airlines have been done taking into account the country where are based in. As example, Cathay Dragon has been categorized as &quot;Eastern Asia&quot;, since is a Hong Kong-based airline.</p>
<p>As represented, on January 22, in China, there were already more than 500 positive cases. In addition, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States reported their first cases. During the next 30 days, is visible how the virus spreads rapidly inside China. In this stage, the airlines cancelling more frequencies are all based in Asia. The unique exception is United Airlines, who cancels some frequencies due to 'significant decline in demand' for China service <span class="citation">(Josephs, L. <a href="references.html#ref-NewsUnited">2020</a>)</span>. From February 19, is illustrated the virus spreading acceleration outside China. In just 5 five days South Korea has 920 more confirmed cases, Italy 258, Japan 67 and Iran 71. Until March 9, the rise of cases in South Korea is followed by an increase of cancelled frequencies by Korean Air, which even ranks as the airline with more frequencies cancelled from March 3 to March 10.</p>
<p>In later February and early March the virus is also spreading fiercely in Italy and Iran, surpassing South Korea in cases on March 10. With this, first colour changes start arriving in airines graphic. In just one day Alitalia cancells more than 1 K frequencies, being on March 6, the 4th airline in frequencies cancelled. This is not all, since on March 10 Italy announces the lockdown of the country aand three more european airlines rank in the top 20 of the most hit airlines. These are Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways.</p>
<p>On March 11, is declared the global pandemic and Trump announces the travel ban from Europe from March 13. On March 12, the big three north-american Airlines<br />
have already cancelled more than 600 frequencies each. In the next days Europe becomes the epicenter of the pandemic and on March 16, 6 out of the 10 most affected countries are european. Example is Spain, where confirmed cases more than triple in just 6 days. One of the major changes in the airlines illustration arrives on March 14, when Lufthansa Group (Lufthnsa, Eurowings, SWISS and Brussels Airlines) cancells more than 18 K frequencies. By March 20, the group will be grounding 700 out of 763 aircraft, flying only the 5% of its programme <span class="citation">(Eurocontrol <a href="references.html#ref-LufthansaGroup20M">2020</a>)</span>, or in other words, cancelling more than 24 K frequencies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the evolution of the confirmed cases, on March 20 China is still in the first place. Nevertheless, it seems the country has managed to flattening the curve. In the second place is located Italy, where each day are added 2 K cases. Followed by Spain, also confirming around 2 K new cases per day.</p>
<p>In the next 7 days, some airlines like Qatar, British Airways and AirAsia add new cancellations. The virus is now spreading agressivly in Nortern America, the United States, which had 3 K positives on March 15, has more than 100 K confirmed cases and ranks as the most hit country on March 27.</p>
<p>During the last stage of this study, from March 27 until April 7, the number of cases keep increasing. In Germany for example, on April 4, the reported cases surpassed those reprted by China. In the United States the cases more than triple in just 10 days. It is also important to notice how Brazil starts gaining positions, Southern America will be the last region hit by COVID-19 and is in early April, when the virus starts spreading. From the airlines point of view, in this last stage, there are no major alterations a part from a 1 K increase of American Airlines.</p>
<p>The animations conclude on April 7 showing that 6 out of the 10 most hit countries are European. Summing up more than 450 K confirmed cases together. Meanwhile, the United States, is now the most hit country surpassing the 360 K cases and China is in the 5th position with 82 K positives.</p>
<p>Regarding the air carriers, the European airlines are the ones that have reduced more frequencies. Lufthansa is in the first position and all the members of its group are in the top 10. The low-cost airline Ryanair is also in this ranking, with more than 2 K frequencies cancelled. It is important to notice, there is only one Northen America airline in the top 10; American Airlines. And finally, there are 4 Asian airlines in the top 10. Two of them from the Persian Gulf (Western Asia): Emirates Airlines and Qatar Airway, one from Malaysia (Southeastern Asia): Air Asia and Air China from China (Eastern Asia).</p>
<p>In conclusion, it has been found a direct relationship between the number of cases per region and the airlines cancelling more frequencies. It has been visible that in late January and early March, when the most affected region was Asia, the airlines reducing more frequencies were based in this region. Moreover, when South Korea raised in positives the flag carried of the country also increased its cancellations. This same behaviour has been followed by Italy and its main airline Alitalia. Nevertheless, after the outbreak in Italy and with the virus spreading Europe no more direct relationships between countries and flag-carrietrs have been detected. The virus is no more focused on one country, being a reality around Europe and with all countries applying measures all the European carriers are being affected. This is likely to be the reason of not seeing any specific behaviour, although, the realtioship airline-region is still present.</p>
<p>It has been also noticeable the North-American airlines reaction to the travel ban from Europe. It is important to highlight, in the moment the decision was taken were around 1 K confirmed cases in the States. So this is clearly a reaction to a goverment measure rather than the number of cases.</p>
<p>In any case,even in Asia and Europe, where it has been seen a direct realtionship between the cases per country and the number of cancelled frequencies by the flag-carrier; it cannot be ensured that the airlines where reacting to the confirmed cases value. There are more likely to be reactions in front of goverment measures and drops in demand, rather than the number of COVID-19 postives. This can be corraborated with the analysis done in the previous section where are explained some goverment measures and is seen the airlines reaction. However, there is a direct relationship between the number of cases and the demand, which at the same time is related with the reductions of frequencies. It is because of that, it cannot be obtained a general conclusion. It would be necesarry to analyse every airline adjustment considering the moment the decision was taken, their forecasts in demand and the goverment measures applied in that moment.</p>
